- In Hw1, I implemented a Decision Tree ML algorithm using the scikit-learn decision tree classifier to classify real vs. fake 
news headlines, with an accuracy of ~74%. Also, I analyzed KNN and derived the vectorized Regularized Linear Regression.

- In Hw2, I explored and compared the performance and characteristics of two classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors (~94% accuracy)and Logistic Regression (~92% accuracy). Also, I implemented the Locally Weighted Regression. 

- In Hw3, I trained a Naive Bayes model to classify several pictures of a single digit to the correct digit. ~84% accuracy.
